    "The gap between numbers in the floating point system is relative to the size of the numbers. According to the book, the next consecutive number after 1 is $1+2^{-52} = 1+eps()$, so $1+eps()$ is able to be stored correctly in the system. Then when we subract 1 from it, we get the correct answer of $eps()$. On the other hand, the next consecutive number after 2 is twice the number following 1 and is equal to $2+2^{-52}*2 = 2 + 2^{-51}$. Since $eps() < 2^{-51}$, the system is incable of storing $2+eps()$ because in falls in between the gap of the two consecutive numbers : $2$ and $2 + 2^{-51}$. We learned in class that the system will always round down in ambiguous situations, thus, $2+eps()$ is rounded down to 2 and when we subtract 2 from it, we get 0, which is wrong. Another way to look at it is to use the fundamental axiom of floating point arithmetic which states \"every operation of floating point arithmetic is exact up to a relative error of size at most $\\epsilon_{machine}$\". In other words, the error in floating point arithmetic scales with the size of the numbers. The statement $2+eps()-2$ has an error equal to the size of $\\epsilon_{machine}$. The statement $1+eps()-1$ has an error that is half the size of this, i.e smaller than machine epsilon, which is negligible and thus produces the correct answer. "
